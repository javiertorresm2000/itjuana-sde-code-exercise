This is an application to solve the SDE Code Challenge for ITJuana's Coding Challenge

STEPS TO EXECUTE THE APP

1. Make sure you have installed NodeJS and NPM, if not, you must install them globally to make this project work, here's a very well explained blog on how to set this up https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac
2. Clone the repository in your local env with "git clone https://github.com/javiertorresm2000/itjuana-sde-code-exercise.git" if you're getting this from GitHub, if you have the folder just place it in the directory of your preference
3. Go to the directory and open a terminal in it, then run in the terminal "npm start", and the application should run
4. In case something goes wrong, just type "node index.js" and the application should run
5. In the directory you'll find 2 files "addresses.txt" and "names.txt", you are able to edit them in order to add more addresses or names, if you want to add more they should be separated by a line break (Enter)
6. First, The application will ask you for the path of the file where you have the addresses, in this case you just need to type "addresses.txt" because they're in the same directory
7. Second, you'll have to do the same with the path of the names file, in this case "names.txt"
8. And Finally You should see the output in the terminal with a Correlation of the services and the drivers according with the specification of the Coding Challenge and the application should finish
